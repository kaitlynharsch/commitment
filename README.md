This is a fairly straightforward website about my cat!

You can learn about him throughout the page and can interact with some features.
I was able to implement CSS shapes, patterns, and animation, as well as using Google fonts and icons in this project.

CSS shapes: the hearts seen at the top.
CSS patterns: the background.
CSS animation: not sure if its animation or more of an activation, but upon hovering over images, it adds a drop shadow causing
the image to look 3D, and the cursor changes to a paw print upon hovering over images and the links in the nav bar as well as the link/"learn more" button further down on the page!
Google fonts: took Montserrat, a sans-serif font from google fonts with various font weights that looked good.
Google Icons: took the pay print icon and turned it into a cursor!

Read and hover over different aspects of the site to watch them change!

Thank you!

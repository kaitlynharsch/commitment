      <h2>Balinese Cats</h2>
      <h3>Brief Description</h3>
      <p>The Balinese cat is a very special breed. They are a distant relative to the Siamese cat, however they are long-haired and are their own separate breed.</p>
      <p>These cats are very smart, social, talkative, playful and curious. They have similar body markings to the Siamese, with a white body, blue eyes, and brown/black paws, tails, ears, and parts of their face.</p>
      <p>A common misconception about these cats is that the name and breed originated from Bali, in Indonesia. However, this is not true, they were named after the Balinese dancers due to their graceful nature that resembled the grace and poise of
        these dancers.</p>
      <h3>Hypoallergenic Claims</h3>
      <p>Although no cats are 100% hypoallergenic, many studies have found that Balinese cats are one of the few cat breeds that are close enough to be considered hypoallergenic.</p>
      <p>To understand this further, you must understand what causes cat allergies. Cats produce 2 proteins in their saliva, called Fel d1 and Fel d4 proteins, that some humans are allergic to.</p>
      <p>When a cat licks their fur then sheds that fur, or you pet them, you may have an allergic reaction to this protein. However, Balinese cats genetically produce less of these 2 proteins.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Balinese do not have an undercoat that is typical of most long-haired cat breeds. This means they shed less, therefore spreading the allergen proteins less than other cat breeds.</p>

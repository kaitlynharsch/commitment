      <h2>Balinese Cats</h2>
      <h3>Brief Description</h3>
      <p>The Balinese cat is a very special breed. They are a distant relative to the Siamese cat, however they are long-haired and are their own separate breed.</p>
      <p>These cats are very smart, social, talkative, playful and curious. They have similar body markings to the Siamese, with a white body, blue eyes, and brown/black paws, tails, ears, and parts of their face.</p>
      <p>A common misconception about these cats is that the name and breed originated from Bali, in Indonesia. However, this is not true, they were named after the Balinese dancers due to their graceful nature that resembled the grace and poise of
        these dancers.</p>
      <h3>Hypoallergenic Claims</h3>
      <p>Although no cats are 100% hypoallergenic, many studies have found that Balinese cats are one of the few cat breeds that are close enough to be considered hypoallergenic.</p>
      <p>To understand this further, you must understand what causes cat allergies. Cats produce 2 proteins in their saliva, called Fel d1 and Fel d4 proteins, that some humans are allergic to.</p>
      <p>When a cat licks their fur then sheds that fur, or you pet them, you may have an allergic reaction to this protein. However, Balinese cats genetically produce less of these 2 proteins.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Balinese do not have an undercoat that is typical of most long-haired cat breeds. This means they shed less, therefore spreading the allergen proteins less than other cat breeds.</p>

      <h2>FAQs:</h2>
      <h3>Q1: How much does Bentley weigh?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Bentley may look like a bigger cat... however he is simply just big boned. Just kidding. Bentley is a long haired cat which makes his body look bigger than it really is. He weighs in at just about 11 pounds. The average cat weighs
        about 10 pounds, so he is slightly over this average, but is very happy and healthy! </p>
      <h3>Q2: When is Bentley's birthday?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Bentley's exact birthday is unknown. The shelter and my best guess is about July 4th! However in most adoption cases where the birthday is unknown, the "gotcha day" is celebrated instead, which is the day the adoption took place! So Bentley's Gotcha Day is on September 16, 2020. Yes, he is a quarantine kitty and definitely acts like it.</p>
      <h3>Q3: Is Bentley an indoor or outdoor cat?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Bentley is mostly an indoor cat, with the exception that he LOVES going onto balconies, and on hikes in his backpack. I have balconies on my place in Boulder and at my parent's house, and he wants to be outside on the balcony almost all day, everyday, but any further than that and he is way too scared!</p>
